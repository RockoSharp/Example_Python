# Example_Python
This is a script I wrote for some folks to swap generic fields in job files.  It's really a demo of my style.

My main goal was to write readable code in 'swap_generic_fields.py' for an audience considering migrating from perl.  I also want the code to act as the spec so there isn't a need to keep an external document in sync.

'Support_Functions.py' is meant to:
- show elements of the code that could be moved to a more generic library.
- prototype and interface I would like to get some data.
- parse the command line arguments which I felt could get more attention than it's worth by folks new to python
